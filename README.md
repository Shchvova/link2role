# Link 2 Role

Simple service granting user roles, using static HTML & JavaScript, Discord API and Cloudflare Workers to communicate with it

Discord is amazing service, but managing big server with lots of roles can be daring, especially when trying to combine it with other services. This is why I created a bot and service to allow me award a role with simple link.

Yon can enjoy it at https://link2role.svoka.com/

All source code is available here. Website itself is plain html/js/css. No npm or anything. I used Coudflare web editor to deploy Worker in worker.js and Workers KV to store data.

Enjoy!
